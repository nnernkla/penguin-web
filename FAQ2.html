 <h3>How do penguins sleep?</h3>
 <div>
 	<p>Penguins sleep for a few minutes at a time any time of the day or night, 
 	wherever they are,although they sleep for longer periods on land and at night. 
 	They will sleep in a wide range of positions - sitting in the water, standing up, 
 	lying down, sitting or in some species, even perched in a tree. Crested penguins 
 	can often be seen sleeping with part of their bill tucked under a flipper</p>
 </div>
 <h3>What do penguins look like when they hatch?</h3>
 <div>
 	<p>The size of penguin chicks at hatching varies according to the species. 
 	Blue penguins have the smallest chicks and weigh just 35 grams at hatching. 
 	When penguins hatch, they are initially covered in a sparse down, usually brown with a white chest. 
 	After a week or two this is replaced with a much thicker layer of secondary down. 
 	When the chick approaches full size the down is replaced by feathers.</p>
 </div>
 <h3>Do penguins bite?</h3>
 <div>
 	<p>Yes, penguins defend themselves and their nest sites with their beaks and wings. 
 	They bite fiercely and also use their thick, strap-like, wings to beat their opponent. 
 	Blue penguins and most of the crested species are regular fighters, often getting into 
 	bloody brawls during the breeding season. The more reclusive species, like yellow-eyed penguins, 
 	rarely fight among themselves, but are still prepared to bite anybody that comes too close. 
 	Like most penguins, the species in New Zealand do not like being handled by humans. 
 	The closest thing to being beaten up by a penguin is being grabbed with a pair of 
 	needle-nosed pliers and beaten with sandals!</p>
 </div>
 <!--h3>Do penguins have knees?</h3>
 <div>
 	<p>Yes. Penguins appear to have very short legs and no knees because only the lower leg is externally visible. 
 	Their knees and upper legs are feather covered, hiding them from view. This also means that penguins 
 	never get cold knees!</p>
 </div>
 <h3>How long do penguins live for?</h3>
 <div>
 	<p>Most species have an average life expectancy of about 10 years, although some individuals occasionally live 
 	for up to 25 years. The graph to the right plots the age of flipper-banded yellow-eyed penguins at either death 
 	or the last live recovery. 40% of all chicks banded are never recovered and are presumed dead.</p>
 </div!-->
 <h3>What do penguins eat?</h3>
 <div>
 	<p>The diet of penguins varies between species and in some cases, location. 
 	The species taken include a wide range of fish, squid, octopus and euphausids (shrimp-like animals). 
 	Some species of penguin target surface-schooling fish species 
 	while others are mid-water or bottom feeders.</p>
 </div>
 <h3>How do humans exploit penguins?</h3>
 <div>
 	<p>In numerous places around the world, penguins have been exploited for food, oil and skins and even 
 	used as fish bait. As well as adult penguins, their eggs have also been exploited and in some places 
 	they are still collected today. Tourism is another form of exploitation. There are many sites in the world 
 	where tourists can visit penguins in the wild and this is not always beneficial to the penguins or their 
 	environment. Penguins are also taken from the wild and held in zoos for benefit of us curious humans. </p>
 </div>
 <h3>What do penguins drink?</h3>
 <div>
	<p>Penguins drink any water they can get access to - fresh or salt. When ashore they will drink fresh water 
	from pools and streams and can sometimes be seen drinking water preened off their backs during rain showers. 
	At sea penguins must drink salt water and they are able to do this because they have special glands abound 
	the eye sockets that extract excess salt from the blood. The excess salt is excreted as a salty fluid 
	through the nasal passages.</p>
