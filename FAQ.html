 <h3>Are penguins birds?</h3>
 <div>
 	<p>Yes, penguins are birds (Aves) in that they have feathers, 
 lay eggs and have forelimbs modified as wings, but in this case used for swimming. 
 They also share all the other characteristics of birds, being warm-blooded (around 40 deg C) 
 and having a reduced reproductive system (one functional ovary or testis).</p>
 </div>
 <h3>Do penguins have feathers or fur?</h3>
 <div>
 	<p>Yes, like all other birds, penguins have feathers. Penguin feathers are short, 
 	overlapping and densely packed. The outer part of the feather is waterproof while 
 	the inner down section traps an insulating layer of air, keeping the penguin warm 
 	in the sometimes freezing water. Unlike those of flying birds, the feathers on a 
 	penguin wing are very short.</p>
 </div>
 <h3>Do all penguins live at the South Pole?</h3>
 <div>
 	<p>No penguins live actually at the South Pole but two species do live on the edges 
 	of the Antarctic continent. The islands of the antarctic and sub-antarctic support 
 	the largest number of species, there are several species that live in temperate climates 
 	and one at the equator (the Galapagos penguin). No penguins live in the northern hemisphere..</p>
 </div>
 <h3>Do penguins have knees?</h3>
 <div>
 	<p>Yes. Penguins appear to have very short legs and no knees because only the lower leg is externally visible. 
 	Their knees and upper legs are feather covered, hiding them from view. This also means that penguins 
 	never get cold knees!</p>
 </div>
 <h3>How long do penguins live for?</h3>
 <div>
 	<p>Most species have an average life expectancy of about 10 years, although some individuals occasionally live 
 	for up to 25 years. The graph to the right plots the age of flipper-banded yellow-eyed penguins at either death 
 	or the last live recovery. 40% of all chicks banded are never recovered and are presumed dead.</p>
 </div>
 <h3>Why are penguins black and white?</h3>
 <div>
 	<p>The strategy of having a dark dorsal (upper) surface and a white ventral (lower) surface is one that has been
 	 adopted by many marine animals. Predators looking down see the penguin as a dark shape on a dark background 
 	 and predators looking up see a light shape on a light background - the most effective camoflage for an 
 	 animal that spends most of its time at or near the surface.</p>

 <!--h3>What do penguins drink?</h3>
 <div>
	<p>Penguins drink any water they can get access to - fresh or salt. When ashore they will drink fresh water 
	from pools and streams and can sometimes be seen drinking water preened off their backs during rain showers. 
	At sea penguins must drink salt water and they are able to do this because they have special glands abound 
	the eye sockets that extract excess salt from the blood. The excess salt is excreted as a salty fluid 
	through the nasal passages.</p>
